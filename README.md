# Improved LCARS UI for Star Trek Adventures
This is a module for the Foundry Virtual Tabletop roleplaying platform. It provides an improved LCARS interface for using the "Star Trek Adventures" game system by Modiphius.

It is based and dependent on the awesome https://github.com/mkscho63/sta "Star Trek Adventures (Unofficial)" game system for Foundry VTT by Mike Schoen.

This module re-imagines the UI with a bluish LCARS theme inspired by "Star Trek Online" and "Star Trek: Picard". It covers more of the Foundry UI, is easier on the eyes, and even adds some usability improvements.

This is my first foray into LESS and CSS. The code is anything but beautiful. I'm happy for any pull requests that help me make the LESS stylesheet more elegant and maintainable.
